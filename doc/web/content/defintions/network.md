A **node** is an entity that as the ability to send/receive information.  
A **network** is a group of **nodes**, where each can interact with others.  

![Simple network schema](../img/network.png)

Above is the most common example of a basic network. There is a few *computers*, 
that are all connected to a *router*, that is itself connected to the *internet*.
In this example, everything is considered as a *node*, because both *computers* and the
*router* are able to send/receive data. 

In this usual configuration, *computers* barely interact with each other, and only uses the *router*
to reach the *internet*, nothing more.
