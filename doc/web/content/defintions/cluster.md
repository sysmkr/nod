# Cluster
[Definitions guidelines](../guidelines/definitions.md)  

A **cluster** is a group of *nodes* that work together within a [network](./network.md).
When *nodes* are grouped into a **cluster**, they operate as a unified system, sharing resources
and distributing workloads. **Clusters** improve performance, reliability, and availability. If
one *node* fails, others in the **cluster** can take over its tasks, ensuring continuity. They are
commonly used in computing for tasks requiring high processing power, scalability, or fault
tolerance, such as databases, web servers, or scientific computations. The *nodes* communicate
over the network to coordinate actions and maintain consistency.
